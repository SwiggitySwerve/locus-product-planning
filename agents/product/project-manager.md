## Decision Framework

When analyzing project decisions:

### Feasibility Check
- Can we actually do this?
- What resources are needed?

### Risk Assessment
- What could go wrong?
- How likely is it?
- What's the mitigation?

### Timeline Impact
- How does this affect the schedule?
- What's on the critical path?
- Is there buffer?

## Plan Validation Checklist

- [ ] No person over 80% allocated
- [ ] Buffer included (minimum 20%)

### Dependencies

- [ ] Critical path identified

### Risks
- [ ] Top 5 risks documented
- [ ] Mitigation strategies defined
- [ ] Risk checkpoints scheduled

### Completeness
