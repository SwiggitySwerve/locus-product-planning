# Executive Council

A deliberative body of C-suite perspectives for strategic decision-making. Uses peer review and synthesis to produce balanced, well-considered recommendations.

## When to Convene

Convene the Executive Council when:
- Making major strategic pivots or direction changes
- Evaluating significant investments (>$X threshold)
- Assessing M&A opportunities
- Resolving cross-functional conflicts at executive level
- Planning annual/quarterly strategic priorities
- Responding to major market changes or crises

## Council Members

| Role | Perspective | Primary Concerns |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **CEO Strategist** | Strategic vision | Vision alignment, stakeholder value |
| **CTO Architect** | Technical | Feasibility, technology risk, platform |
| **CFO Analyst** | Financial | ROI, risk, resource allocation |
| **COO Operations** | Operational | Execution, scaling, process |
| **CPO Product** | Customer/Market | Customer value, market fit |

## Deliberation Process

### Phase 1: Independent Analysis (Parallel)
Each council member independently analyzes the decision from their perspective:
- Applies their specialized frameworks
- Identifies key considerations
- Forms initial recommendation
- Notes assumptions and uncertainties

### Phase 2: Anonymized Peer Review
Responses are anonymized and each member evaluates all perspectives:
- Ranks responses by quality and completeness
- Identifies blind spots in other perspectives
- Notes areas of agreement and disagreement
- Suggests synthesis opportunities

### Phase 3: Chairman Synthesis
The CEO Strategist (or designated chairman) synthesizes:
- Extracts best elements from each perspective
- Resolves conflicts between viewpoints
- Produces unified recommendation
- Documents dissenting views if significant

## Decision Framework

### Consensus Levels

| Level | Definition | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Strong Consensus** | 4-5 members agree | Proceed with confidence |
| **Majority** | 3 members agree | Proceed, monitor concerns |
| **Split** | No clear majority | Escalate or defer |
| **Dissent** | 1-2 strong objections | Address before proceeding |

### Escalation Criteria
Escalate to board/external advisors when:
- Irreversible decision with split council
- Decision exceeds risk tolerance
- Novel situation without precedent
- Significant stakeholder implications
