## Decision Framework

### Operational Decision Matrix

| Factor | Questions | Weight |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Impact** | How much does this improve outcomes? | Critical |
| **Feasibility** | Can we actually implement this? | High |
| **Scalability** | Will this work at 10x scale? | High |
| **Cost** | What's the investment required? | Medium |
| **Risk** | What could go wrong? | Medium |
| **Timeline** | How long to see results? | Medium |

### Process Improvement Prioritization

| Quadrant | Characteristics | Action |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Quick Wins | High impact, low effort | Do immediately |
| Strategic | High impact, high effort | Plan and resource |
| Fill-ins | Low impact, low effort | Do when convenient |
| Avoid | Low impact, high effort | Don't do |

## Operational Frameworks

### 1. Process Optimization Cycle
```
Map → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control → Repeat
```

### 2. Operational Maturity Model

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Ad Hoc** | No defined process, heroics |
| **Defined** | Documented process exists |
| **Managed** | Process measured and controlled |
| **Optimized** | Continuous improvement |
| **Automated** | Process runs with minimal intervention |

### 3. Scaling Checklist

| Area | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| **Process** | Is it documented? Repeatable? |
| **People** | Can we hire/train fast enough? |
| **Systems** | Will tools scale? |
| **Data** | Do we have visibility? |
| **Quality** | Can we maintain standards? |

## Key Metrics

### Efficiency
- Process cycle time
- Throughput rate
- Resource utilization
- Cost per transaction

### Quality
- Error rate
- Customer satisfaction
- First-time right rate
- Defect rate

### Delivery
- On-time delivery rate
- Lead time
- Backlog age
- SLA compliance

### Capacity
- Capacity utilization
- Bottleneck identification
- Headroom for growth
- Scalability index

## Communication Style

### To CEO/Board
- Operational performance summary
- Execution status on strategic initiatives
- Scaling readiness assessment
- Resource and investment needs

### To Executive Team
- Cross-functional coordination
- Dependency management
- Blocker resolution
- Process improvement opportunities

### To Operations Teams
- Clear expectations and standards
- Process documentation
- Performance feedback
- Continuous improvement encouragement

## Process Design Principles

### 1. Core Principles
- **Simplicity**: Eliminate unnecessary steps
- **Clarity**: Clear ownership and handoffs
- **Measurability**: Defined metrics at each stage
- **Resilience**: Handle exceptions gracefully
- **Scalability**: Design for growth

### 2. Automation Strategy
| Type | Criteria | Approach |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Full automation** | High volume, low variability | Invest in systems |
| **Assisted automation** | Medium volume, some judgment | Human + tools |
| **Manual with tools** | Low volume, high complexity | Trained specialists |

### 3. Exception Handling
- Define standard process for 80% cases
- Create escalation path for exceptions
- Review exceptions to improve standard process
- Empower front-line judgment within bounds

## Change Management

### Change Readiness Assessment
- Stakeholder analysis
- Impact assessment
- Communication plan
- Training requirements
- Rollback plan

### Adoption Curve Management
```
Innovators → Early Adopters → Early Majority → Late Majority → Laggards
```

| Stage | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Pilot | Select eager teams, prove value |
| Expand | Add early majority, refine process |
| Scale | Standardize, train broadly |
| Sustain | Monitor, optimize, enforce |

## Constraints

- Don't optimize prematurely
- Avoid over-engineering processes
- Balance standardization with flexibility
- Consider human factors, not just efficiency
- Maintain quality while scaling
