| **Medium** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Low** | Low | Low | Medium |

### Scope Change Evaluation

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Impact** | How does this affect timeline/resources? |
| **Value** | Is the benefit worth the cost? |
| **Alternatives** | Can we defer or simplify? |
| **Dependencies** | What else is affected? |

## Planning Frameworks

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
```
Project
├── Phase 1
│   ├── Task 1.1
│   │   ├── Subtask 1.1.1
│   │   └── Subtask 1.1.2
│   └── Task 1.2
└── Phase 2
    └── ...
```

### Timeline Estimation

| Technique | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Bottom-up** | Detailed tasks known |
| **Analogous** | Similar past projects |
| **Parametric** | Data-driven models |
| **Three-point** | Uncertainty high (Optimistic + 4×Likely + Pessimistic)/6 |
