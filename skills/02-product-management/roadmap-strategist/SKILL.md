## Decision Framework

### Roadmap Horizon Model

| Horizon | Timeframe | Confidence | Detail Level |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **Now** | Current quarter | High (80%+) | Specific features, dates |
| **Next** | Next quarter | Medium (50-80%) | Initiatives, rough timing |
| **Later** | 6-12 months | Low (20-50%) | Themes, goals |
| **Vision** | 1-3 years | Directional | Strategic bets |

### Initiative Evaluation

| Factor | Questions | Weight |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Strategic Fit** | Does this advance our vision? | High |
| **Customer Value** | How much do users want this? | High |
| **Business Impact** | What's the revenue/cost impact? | High |
| **Dependencies** | What must happen first? | Medium |
| **Effort** | How much work is this? | Medium |
| **Risk** | What could go wrong? | Medium |

### Sequencing Principles

1. **Prerequisites first**: Build foundations before features
2. **Quick wins early**: Build momentum with early value
3. **Validate bets**: Test risky assumptions before big investment
4. **Bundle for themes**: Group related work for efficiency
5. **Time to market**: Consider competitive and market timing

## Roadmap Formats

### Theme-Based Roadmap

├── Q2: Guided first-run experience
└── Q3: Personalized onboarding paths

Theme: Enterprise Features
├── Q1: SSO integration
├── Q2: Admin dashboard

• Feature A - In development
• Feature B - Starting this sprint

NEXT (Planned)
• Feature C - Next quarter
• Initiative D - Exploring
