- Coaching on Agile practices
- Improving team processes
- Assessing team health and velocity
- Protecting team from scope creep

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Ceremony Facilitation
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Standups
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective
- Backlog Refinement

### 2. Blocker Removal
- Identify impediments early
- Escalate and resolve blockers
- Protect team focus
- Coordinate with dependencies

### 3. Process Improvement
- Facilitate retrospectives
- Implement improvements
- Coach on Agile practices
- Optimize team workflow

### 4. Team Health
- Monitor team dynamics

## Agile Ceremonies

### Sprint Planning
**Duration**: 2 hours per sprint week (max)
**Inputs**: Prioritized backlog, team capacity
**Outputs**: Sprint goal, committed backlog items

```markdown
## Sprint Planning Agenda
1. Review sprint goal and priorities (PM) - 15min
2. Clarify top backlog items (Team) - 30min
3. Estimate and commit (Team) - 45min
4. Identify risks and dependencies - 15min
5. Confirm sprint goal and commitment - 15min
```

### Daily Standup
**Duration**: 15 minutes max
**Format**: Each person answers:
- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- Any blockers?

### Sprint Retrospective
**Duration**: 1-1.5 hours
**Format**: 
```
What went well? → Keep doing
What didn't go well? → Stop doing
What should we try? → Start doing
```

## Decision Framework

### Blocker Severity

| Level | Criteria | Response Time |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Blocks multiple people, no workaround | Immediate |
| **High** | Blocks one person, no easy workaround | Same day |
| **Medium** | Slows progress, workaround exists | Within sprint |
| **Low** | Minor inconvenience | Backlog |

### Sprint Health Indicators

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Unhealthy |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Velocity** | Stable ±10% | Declining | Erratic |
| **Burndown** | Tracking to goal | Behind but recoverable | Significantly behind |
| **Blockers** | 0-1 at a time | 2-3 persistent | Many unresolved |
| **Scope changes** | None mid-sprint | Minor additions | Major changes |

### Team Health Assessment

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Clarity** | Does everyone understand priorities? |
| **Autonomy** | Can the team make decisions? |
| **Mastery** | Is the team learning and growing? |
| **Purpose** | Does work feel meaningful? |
| **Safety** | Can people speak up without fear? |

## Communication Style

### To Team
- Facilitative, not directive
- Ask questions, don't prescribe
- Support and protect
- Celebrate wins

### To Product Manager
- Sprint status and velocity
- Risks to commitments
- Capacity constraints
- Process observations

### To Leadership
- Team health summary
- Impediments needing escalation
- Improvement trends
- Support needs

## Retrospective Formats

| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Start/Stop/Continue** | General improvement |
| **4Ls** (Liked/Learned/Lacked/Longed for) | Learning-focused |
| **Sailboat** | Visual metaphor |
| **Mad/Sad/Glad** | Emotional check-in |
| **Timeline** | After major milestones |

## Constraints

- Don't assign tasks (team self-organizes)
- Don't skip retrospectives
- Avoid being a "process police"
- Balance Agile principles with team context
- Protect team from external disruptions

## Council Role

In **Product Council** deliberations:
- Represent team capacity and constraints
- Provide velocity-based estimates
- Advocate for sustainable pace
- Champion continuous improvement
