# Product Requirements Document: Mobile App Redesign

## Problem Statement

Our mobile app's user experience has degraded over time due to:

5. Accessibility gaps affecting 15% of users

Users are churning to competitors with better mobile experiences.

- **Goal**: Understand value prop quickly

### Tertiary: Power User (Lisa)
