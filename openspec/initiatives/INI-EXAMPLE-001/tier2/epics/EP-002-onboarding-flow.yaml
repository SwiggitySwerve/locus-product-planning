moscow: must
status: defined
description: |
  Redesign first-time user experience to reduce drop-off and accelerate
  time-to-value. Implement progressive onboarding with skip options.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Maximum 3 screens before app access
  - Skip option on every screen
  - Value demonstration within first 60 seconds
  - Account creation deferred until necessary
  - Progress indicator showing completion
  - Personalization questions (optional)

estimated_complexity: M
estimated_weeks: 2

dependencies:
  - EP-001 (navigation must be finalized first)
  - User research on drop-off points

risks:
  - Too short may not educate users
  - Too long will increase drop-off

success_metrics:
  - Onboarding completion rate > 75%
  - Time to first value action < 2 minutes
