# Strategic Mandate: Mobile App Redesign

## Vision Alignment

This initiative directly supports our 2024 strategic goal of "Mobile-First Customer Experience." The current mobile app has significant UX debt accumulated over 3 years of feature additions without holistic design updates.

## Strategic Priority

**Priority Level**: High (P1)

The mobile app represents 45% of our user interactions but only 20% of conversions. Competitive analysis shows we're losing market share to competitors with more modern, intuitive mobile experiences.

## Resource Commitment

- **Engineering**: 4 FTEs for 4 months
- **Design**: 2 FTEs for 3 months
- **QA**: 1 FTE for 2 months
- **Budget**: $450,000 (including contractor support)

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Engagement (sessions/user/week) | 2.3 | 3.5 | Analytics |
| Onboarding completion | 40% | 75% | Funnel analysis |
| App store rating | 3.8 | 4.5 | App Store/Play Store |
| DAU/MAU | 15% | 30% | Analytics |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep | High | High | Strict MoSCoW prioritization, weekly scope reviews |
| User resistance to change | Medium | Medium | Beta program, gradual rollout, A/B testing |
| Technical debt discovery | Medium | High | 2-week discovery sprint before committing to timeline |
| Resource availability | Low | High | Cross-training, contractor backup plan |
