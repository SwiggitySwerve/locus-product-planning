## Summary

HealthBridge is a HIPAA-compliant telemedicine platform enabling video consultations between 200 doctors and patients across a 15-clinic healthcare network.

### Quick Stats
- **Budget**: $3.2M over 24 months
- **Team**: 15 people (10 eng, 2 design, 2 PM, 1 compliance)
- **Timeline**: 12-month pilot, 18-month full launch
- **Sprints**: 12 (2-week each)
- **Compliance**: HIPAA required, SOC 2 path planned

### Planning Outputs
| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Vision](./vision.md) | Problem, personas, success metrics |
| [Features](./features.md) | MoSCoW prioritized features, user stories |
| [Design](./design.md) | Architecture, ADRs, security model |
| [Test Strategy](./test-strategy.md) | Test pyramid, compliance testing, quality gates |
| [Sprint Plan](./tasks/sprint-plan.md) | 12 sprints with capacity validation |
| [Ops Readiness](./ops-readiness.md) | Monitoring, DR, incident response |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Video Platform | Daily.co | 50% cheaper than Twilio, healthcare-focused |
| EHR Integration | Redox middleware | 80% faster than direct Epic integration |
| Data Storage | AWS HIPAA-eligible | Managed services, BAA available |
| Authentication | Auth0 + MFA | Healthcare SSO, TOTP/hardware key MFA |

---

## Estimation Approach (Improved)

Applied complexity multipliers per updated framework:

| Task Type | Multiplier | Reason |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| EHR integration | 1.5x | External API, complex mapping |
| Video infrastructure | 2.0x | New technology, quality critical |
| HIPAA/Security tasks | 1.3x | Compliance review cycles |
| Cross-team coordination | 1.5x | Multiple integration points |

**Capacity Validation**:
- 10 engineers × 10 days × 6 hrs = 600 hrs/sprint raw
- After 20% buffer = 480 committable hours/sprint
- All sprint plans validated against this capacity

---

## Compliance Handling

### HIPAA Requirements Addressed
- ✅ PHI encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit)
- ✅ Access controls (RBAC with role matrix)
- ✅ Audit logging (7-year retention)
- ✅ BAA tracking (8 vendors identified)
- ✅ Incident response procedure (72-hour notification)

### Pre-Launch Compliance Checklist
- [ ] HIPAA compliance audit
- [ ] Penetration test by CREST-certified firm
- [ ] BAAs signed with all vendors
- [ ] Disaster recovery tested
- [ ] Staff training completed

---

## Testing Strategy (New)

### Quality Gates

| Gate | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| PR Merge | 80% coverage, security scan clean, 2 approvals |
| Staging | E2E pass, no perf regression >10% |
| Production | 48hr staging, compliance sign-off, blue-green deploy |

### Compliance Testing
- HIPAA technical safeguards verification
- PHI access audit testing
- Penetration testing (pre-launch + annual)
- SOC 2 Type II preparation

---

## Operational Readiness (New)

### Readiness Level: L3 - Critical

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Monitoring | Video quality, PHI access, SLOs defined |
| Alerting | P1-P4 levels, PHI breach escalation path |
| Incident Response | 72-hour breach notification procedure |
| Disaster Recovery | RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 1 hour |
| On-Call | 24/7 coverage, 4-week rotation |

---

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| M1: HIPAA Ready | Sprint 4 | Compliant infrastructure, audit logging |
| M2: Video MVP | Sprint 6 | Video calls working, basic scheduling |
| M3: EHR Complete | Sprint 9 | Epic integration, patient sync |
| M4: Pilot Launch | Sprint 12 | 20 doctors, 3 clinics live |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| HIPAA compliance gaps | Medium | Critical | Early compliance review, external audit |
| Epic integration delays | High | High | Redox middleware, Epic sandbox early |
| Doctor adoption resistance | Medium | Medium | Champions program, training |
| Video quality issues | Medium | High | Daily.co SLA, multi-region deployment |
