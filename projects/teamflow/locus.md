## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Real-time sync | Yjs CRDT | Conflict-free, offline support, proven |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Redis | Relational strength, caching |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript | Talent pool, ecosystem |
| Backend | Node.js + Socket.io | Full-stack JS, real-time native |
| Multi-tenancy | Row-level isolation | Simple ops, efficient |
