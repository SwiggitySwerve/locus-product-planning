# TeamFlow - Vision

## What We're Building

TeamFlow is a **real-time collaborative project management platform** designed specifically for engineering teams. It combines the speed and simplicity of Linear with the flexibility and documentation capabilities of Notion.

## The Problem We're Solving

Engineering teams today face fragmented tooling:
- Project boards that don't sync in real-time
- Sprint planning disconnected from actual development work
- Time tracking that lives in separate apps
- No integration between code changes and task status
- Siloed information between PMs, engineers, and leadership

**Result**: Teams waste 20-30% of their time on tool-switching and status updates instead of building.

## Who It's For

### Primary Users

**Engineering Managers**
- Need: Sprint planning, velocity tracking, resource allocation
- Pain: Can't see real-time team progress without interrupting engineers
- Goal: Data-driven sprint decisions without micromanagement

**Software Developers**
- Need: Task management, time tracking, PR linking
- Pain: Updating tickets is disconnected from actual coding workflow
- Goal: Tasks that update automatically as they code

### Secondary Users

**Product Managers**
- Need: Roadmap visualization, stakeholder updates
- Pain: Building status reports manually
- Goal: Live dashboards they can share with stakeholders

**Executives**
- Need: High-level team performance metrics
- Pain: Waiting for weekly reports to understand delivery velocity
- Goal: Real-time visibility without micromanaging

## What Success Looks Like

| Metric | 6-Month Target | 12-Month Target |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Beta users | 500 teams | - |
| Paying customers | - | 200 teams |
| Daily Active Users | 60% of registered | 70% of registered |
| Time saved per user/week | 3 hours | 5 hours |
| NPS Score | 40+ | 50+ |
| GitHub integration usage | 70% of teams | 85% of teams |

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Strength | Our Differentiation |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Linear | Speed, simplicity | + Deep GitHub integration, time tracking |
| Asana | Enterprise features | + Real-time sync, developer-first UX |
| Jira | Customization | + Modern UX, faster performance |
| Monday.com | Visual appeal | + Engineering-specific features |
| Notion | Flexibility | + Purpose-built for sprint management |

**Our Unique Position**: The only project management tool that treats real-time collaboration as a first-class feature, not an afterthought. When one engineer updates a task, everyone sees it instantly—no refresh needed.

## Constraints & Context

- **Budget**: $2.5M over 18 months
- **Team**: 8 engineers, 2 designers, 1 PM (can scale)
- **Timeline**: Beta in 9 months, GA in 14 months
- **Market**: Competitive, but fragmented. Engineering teams actively seeking better tools.

## Risks We're Watching

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Early Warning |
|------|------------|--------|---------------|
| Real-time sync complexity | High | High | Prototype delays |
| Competitive pressure | High | Medium | Feature comparison reviews |
| Integration reliability | Medium | High | Partner API changes |
| Team scaling | Medium | Medium | Hiring pipeline |
